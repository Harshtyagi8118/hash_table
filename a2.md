Part A: Analysis

numRecords(): O(1)
update() - if item does not exist: O(n)
find() - if item is not there: O(n)
remove() - if item is not there: O(n)
remove() - if item is there: O(n)
copy constructor: O(n log n)
move constructor: O(1)
move assignment operator: O(1)
destructor: O(n)


Part B: Suggestions

Implement binary search for finding records, this would improve the efficiency of the find(), remove() and update() functions from O(n) to O(log n).
Implement a resizing mechanism for the hash table, as the current implementation has a fixed capacity, which could lead to collisions and reduced efficiency as the number of records increases.
Implement a cache mechanism to improve the efficiency of frequently accessed records, by storing them in a cache to reduce the number of lookups required.
